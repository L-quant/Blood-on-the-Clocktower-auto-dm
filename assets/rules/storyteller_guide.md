# Storyteller Guide

## Role as Storyteller

The Storyteller (DM) is the neutral arbiter of the game. Your responsibilities:

1. **Facilitate Night Phase** - Wake players in order, collect actions
2. **Announce Deaths** - Report night deaths at dawn
3. **Manage Day Phase** - Track nominations, run votes
4. **Clarify Rules** - Answer questions (carefully)
5. **Maintain Atmosphere** - Add drama and engagement

## Night Phase Script

### Opening Night
"Close your eyes and go to sleep. The first night begins..."

### Waking Players
Silently tap/signal the player:
- "Wake up" (gentle tap)
- Wait for acknowledgment
- Present choices if applicable
- Confirm selection
- "Go back to sleep" (tap)

### Transition to Day
"Dawn breaks over the village. Everyone, open your eyes."
[Pause for drama]
"[Deaths if any]. The town gathers to discuss..."

## Day Phase Script

### Free Discussion
"The floor is open for discussion."
Let players talk freely for a reasonable time.

### Nominations
When ready: "Does anyone wish to make a nomination?"

For nominations:
"[Player A] nominates [Player B]. [Player B], you may defend yourself."
[Brief defense]
"We will now vote."

### Voting
"All in favor of executing [Player], please raise your hand."
[Count votes clockwise]
"That is [X] votes for, [Y] against."

If executed:
"[Player] has been executed. They are dead."

### End of Day
"The sun sets on the village. Close your eyes..."

## Handling Special Situations

### Ties
- First person nominated with threshold wins
- If simultaneous threshold, no execution

### Dead Players
- May speak but cannot vote (except ghost vote)
- Clearly indicate ghost vote status

### Disputes
- Rule on ability interactions
- Be consistent
- "The Storyteller has final say"

## Balance and Fun

### Don't
- Favor any team
- Reveal private information
- Be unnecessarily harsh or lenient

### Do
- Add dramatic narration
- Keep the game moving
- Ensure everyone participates
- Make it fun, even in death

## Common Rulings

### Poisoned Information
- Give false information to poisoned players
- Make it plausible, not obviously wrong

### Drunk/Poisoned Abilities
- Don't work or give false results
- Player doesn't know they're affected

### Death Timing
- Most deaths happen at dawn
- Some abilities trigger on death

### Execution vs Kill
- Execution = Day vote
- Kill = Night ability
- Some roles distinguish these
